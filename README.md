### Usage
Before you begin testing and experimenting, remember to use the Terminal to create a branch by running:
``

### Run tests
Before pushing changes to your branch, I would recommend opening this file:

``

``

install and run stylelint, and eslint

These linters will help you fit your code to this repo's syntax standard.

### Deployment
Once you're done with your changes, remember to ``git pull`` before doing ``git push``. 
This will update your local copy of the project if someone else made changes to the repo while you worked on your part.
